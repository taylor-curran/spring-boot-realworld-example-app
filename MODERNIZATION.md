# Modernization Requirements

## Target Stack
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Containerization with OpenShift compatibility
- Helm charts meeting organizational standards
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Service mesh integration (Istio/Linkerd)
- Prometheus/Grafana observability stack
- External secrets management
- Container registry integration (GHCR/Quay)

## Migration Tasks

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] GHCR container registry
- [ ] Environment protection rules
- [ ] OpenShift deployment integration

### 2. Containerization
- [ ] Multi-stage Dockerfile
- [ ] OpenShift-compatible base images
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Container security scanning

### 3. Helm Charts
- [ ] Organizational Helm chart standards compliance
- [ ] Values files for dev/staging/prod
- [ ] Chart dependencies management
- [ ] OpenShift security context constraints

### 4. Kubernetes Manifests
- [ ] Deployment, Service, ConfigMap
- [ ] Ingress/Route configuration
- [ ] HPA and resource limits
- [ ] Pod Security Standards

### 5. Database Migration
- [ ] PostgreSQL K8s deployment or managed service
- [ ] Data migration scripts
- [ ] Connection pooling configuration
- [ ] Backup/restore procedures

### 7. Infrastructure as Code
- [ ] Terraform/Helm for infrastructure


## Success Metrics

### Performance Improvements
- **Deployment Time**: Reduce from 15+ minutes to <5 minutes
- **Build Time**: Reduce by 40% with optimized containers and caching
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory instead of manual scaling
- **Recovery Time**: Improve from manual recovery to automated self-healing

### Operational Improvements
- **Downtime**: Achieve zero-downtime deployments
- **Observability**: 100% visibility into application performance
- **Security**: Pass all security compliance scans
- **Cost**: Reduce operational overhead by 30-50%

### Developer Experience
- **Local Development**: Complete local environment in <5 minutes
- **Feedback Loops**: Reduce from hours to minutes for build/test cycles
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive runbooks and troubleshooting guides
- **Rollback**: One-click rollback capability
